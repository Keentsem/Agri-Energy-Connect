Question 2: Risk Management Processes (25 Marks)
Risk Management Overview
Definition: Systematic process of identifying, assessing, and responding to project risks to minimize negative impacts and maximize opportunities.
1. Risk Identification Process
Methods for Risk Identification:

Brainstorming: Team sessions to generate risk ideas
Expert Interviews: Consulting with experienced professionals
Checklists: Using standardized risk categories
Historical Data Analysis: Learning from past projects
SWOT Analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

Risk Categories:

Technical Risks: New technology, performance issues
Schedule Risks: Delays, resource availability
Cost Risks: Budget overruns, cost escalation
External Risks: Regulatory changes, market conditions
Organizational Risks: Resource conflicts, skill gaps

2. Risk Assessment
Qualitative Assessment:

Probability: Likelihood of occurrence (High/Medium/Low or 1-10 scale)
Impact: Severity of consequences (High/Medium/Low or 1-10 scale)
Risk Score: Probability Ã— Impact

Quantitative Assessment:

Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
Sensitivity analysis
Monte Carlo simulation
Decision tree analysis

3. Risk Response Planning
Response Strategies:

Avoid: Eliminate the risk by changing project approach
Mitigate: Reduce probability or impact
Transfer: Shift risk to third party (insurance, contracts)
Accept: Acknowledge risk but take no preventive action

4. Risk Monitoring and Control
Key Activities:

Regular risk register updates
Risk trigger monitoring
Implementing contingency plans
Identifying new risks
Evaluating response effectiveness


Question 3: Resource Management & Budget Constraints (20 Marks)
Resource Availability Concepts
Types of Resources:

Human Resources: Skills, expertise, availability
Equipment: Machinery, tools, technology
Materials: Raw materials, supplies
Facilities: Office space, laboratories, manufacturing plants

Resource Leveling
Definition: Technique to resolve resource conflicts by adjusting start and finish dates based on resource constraints.
Resource Leveling Process:

Identify resource conflicts in initial schedule
Analyze resource requirements vs. availability
Adjust activity timing to smooth resource usage
Maintain critical path where possible
Document revised schedule

Benefits:

Eliminates resource over-allocation
Creates realistic schedule
Improves resource utilization
Reduces project stress

Limitations:

May extend project duration
Reduces schedule flexibility
Can impact critical path

Types of Project Costs
Direct Costs:

Labor costs for project team members
Materials and supplies
Equipment purchases or rentals
Subcontractor fees
Travel expenses

Indirect Costs:

Administrative overhead
Utilities and facilities
Management support
Legal and accounting services

Fixed Costs:

Remain constant regardless of project activity level
Examples: Equipment purchase, facility rental

Variable Costs:

Change with project activity level
Examples: Materials, hourly labor

Sunk Costs:

Already incurred and cannot be recovered
Should not influence future decisions

Budget Management
Budget Development Process:

Estimate activity costs
Aggregate costs by work package
Include contingency reserves
Create time-phased budget
Establish cost baseline


Question 4: Schedule Calculations (10 Marks)
Earliest Start (ES) and Earliest Finish (EF) Times
Forward Pass Calculations:
Earliest Start (ES):

ES = Latest EF of all predecessor activities
For project start: ES = 0

Earliest Finish (EF):

EF = ES + Duration

Calculation Steps:

Start with first activity (ES = 0)
Calculate EF = ES + Duration
For subsequent activities: ES = maximum EF of predecessors
Continue through entire network

Example Calculation:
Activity A: ES = 0, Duration = 3, EF = 0 + 3 = 3
Activity B: ES = 3, Duration = 5, EF = 3 + 5 = 8
Activity C: ES = 8, Duration = 4, EF = 8 + 4 = 12
Key Rules:

Activities cannot start until all predecessors are complete
Use longest path when multiple predecessors exist
Document all calculations clearly


Question 5: Project Management Information Systems (10 Marks)
PMIS Overview
Definition: Computer-based system that provides tools for planning, organizing, and controlling projects.
Common PMIS Features:
